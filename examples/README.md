# Examples

This folder contains basic examples for the `recipe`, `research_note`, and `todo_list` templates. 

For each template:
* look at `template.md` to get a sense of what the Markdown formatting looks like -- but make sure to clik the "edit" button, or download the file and load it in your favorite text editor, to see what the raw text looks like (since github does it's own Markdown rendering by default),
* look at `template.pdf` to get a sense of what the rendered PDF looks like,
* and look at `template.tex` to see what the LaTeX looks like.
