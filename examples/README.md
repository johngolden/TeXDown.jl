# Examples

This folder contains basic examples for the `recipe`, `research_note`, and `todo_list` templates. 

For each template:
* look at `template.md` to get a sense of what the Markdown formatting looks like,
* look at `template.pdf` to get a sense of what the rendered PDF looks like,
* and look at `template.tex` to see what the LaTeX looks like.
